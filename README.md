👨‍💼 Employee Management System – Backend
      The Employee Management System (EMS) is a backend application built using Node.js, Express.js, and MySQL.
      It provides RESTful APIs to manage employees, attendance, leaves, payrolls, and tasks efficiently.
      The system ensures data consistency, secure authentication, and role-based authorization for administrators, HR managers, and employees.

🧠 Project Overview
      This backend service is designed to digitize and automate employee-related operations inside an organization.
      It reduces manual paperwork and helps administrators and HRs handle everything — from employee onboarding to payroll generation — in a single, connected system.
      The EMS backend exposes RESTful APIs that can be connected to any frontend interface (like React, Angular, or mobile apps built with React Native).

🎯 Key Objectives
      Simplify employee management and tracking.
      Automate attendance logging and leave approvals.
      Maintain accurate payroll calculations.
      Enforce role-based access for system security.
      Provide real-time and reliable REST APIs for frontend clients.
